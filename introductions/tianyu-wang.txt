Hi, everyone!
My name is Tianyu Wang. You could also call me teferi for its a name of one planeswalker, 
fantasy charmer from the Magic: The gathering. 
I choose this elective course for I am interested in quantitative investment, 
and deficit of coding ability would prevent me from it.

I like play video games, recently playing the Baldur's Gate 3, It's quite a good game. 
Welcome anyone wants to join me to play video games together.
